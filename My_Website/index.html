        <h1>Welcome to my first site!</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Darwyn Avila-Medina.

        <h2>HTML Site </h2>
        <p>
            This is my first time writing in my own created HTML Website.
            I look forward to figuring out what I want my website to become!
        </p>

        <h2>Animation Project</h2>
        <p>
            My animation is inspired by the Dragon Ball anime.

            It's the dragon balls rotating and floating around in the planet 
            Namek, which is a location in the anime. There is a base of water below 
            and two moons above them in relation to the planet Namek's moons.
