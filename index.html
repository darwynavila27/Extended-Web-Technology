        <p>
            My name is Darwyn Avila-Medina.

        <h2>HTML Site </h2>
        <p>
            This is my first time writing in my own created HTML Website.
            I look forward to figuring out what I want my website to become!

            <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Extended%20Web%20Technology/My_Website/Dragon-Ball-Z.html" target="_blank">Dragon Ball</a>
            is the anime this animation is inspired by. The dragon balls are floating while rotating around in the planet 
            Namek, which is a location in the anime.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a base of water below in addition to two moons above them in relation to the planet Namek's moons. 
            Within the dragon balls, there are red circles which symbolize the stars
            that are on the dragon balls in the anime.
